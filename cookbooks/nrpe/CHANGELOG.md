## 1.5.4

- Documentation fix for pid_file attribute
- Make sure that systemd unit file matches the nrpe user attribute

## 1.5.3

- Add template support for config files
- Remove node.set in default recipe (Issue #27)

## 1.5.2

- Fedora 20+ / RHEL 7+ systems now run the daemon as nrpe/nrpe since the user installed by the package changed
- Fedora 20+ / RHEL 7+ systems now restart on check updates since the systemd scipt doesn't include a reload action
- Removed the retry count for starting the NRPE service, which didn't fix the real issue on RHEL 7+

## 1.5.0

- Added 3 retries with a delay of 3 to the nrpe service start for RHEL/CentOS 7
- Added ability to define node['nrpe']['packages'] as a Hash to add version information as sample below. In your environment specific cookbook, this version infomation for each individual package can be overriden for required versions (instead of latest one). If it is nil it will install latest one from repositories.

  Sample: default['nrpe']['packages'] = { 'nagios-nrpe-server' => {'version' => nil}, 'nagios-plugins' => {'version' => nil}, 'nagios-plugins-basic' => {'version' => nil}, 'nagios-plugins-standard' => {'version' => nil} }

  For backward compatibiility, it will also install packages if it is defined as an array in your env specific cookbook.

## 1.3.0

- Source lsb init-functions in the init script on Ubuntu source installs so the service doesn't start every run
